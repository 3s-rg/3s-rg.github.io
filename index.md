We are excited to announce that we have secured funding for three (!) BMBF-funded,
PhD-student-led research projects as part of the [Software Campus 2024](https://softwarecampus.de/en/)
program.
These projects will run for one to two years starting in March 2024.
If you're interested in supporting these projects as a research assistant, please see below on
how to apply.
For further information on the 3<sup>S</sup> research group, please see our old
website: [MCC @ TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/mcc).

## Open Positions

We are currently looking for highly motivated students to join us as research
assistants (f/m/x) for three BMBF-funded projects starting in March 2024
(see project descriptions below).

Please see announcements on the TU Berlin website:

1. [Student assistant (60 hours per month)](https://www.jobs.tu-berlin.de/en/job-postings/179053)

We encourage interested students to apply by e-mail to Prof. David Bermbach.

## Software Campus Projects 2024

Here are brief project descriptions.

### EMPIRIS: Efficient Monitoring of Performance in Release and Integration Pipelines in Agile Software Development

<!-- <img src="/empiris-logo.png" style="width: 200px"> -->

Agile software development places a strong focus on iterative development of
features, which are tested automatically as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
Due to high costs, performance testing is usually not used, which leads to
performance problems not being detected. In the EMPIRIS project, a framework
for automated performance testing is being developed, which optimizes the
execution of tests and benchmarks in terms of resource and time expenditure.

The EMPIRIS project is headed by [Nils Japke](https://www.tu.berlin/en/mcc/about-us/team/nils-japke)
and executed in partnership with [DATEV eG](https://www.datev.de/web/de/startseite/startseite-n/)
and [TRUMPF Werkzeugmaschinene SE + Co. KG.](https://www.trumpf.com/).
The project duration is two years.

* ["Efficiently Detecting Performance Changes in FaaS Application Releases"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03889). M. Grambow, T. Dockenfu√ü, T. Schirmer, N. Japke, D. Bermbach. 2023

### CoDes: Co-Design of Serverless Platforms and Applications

<img src="/codes-logo.png" style="width: 200px">

Serverless computing is a new cloud paradigm in which an application consisting
of small functions is operated by the provider as a black box.
Runtime optimization can achieve large improvements in quality of service and
cost, but is inherently limited without application knowledge.
The project aims to investigate how domain knowledge of the application can be
communicated to the platform and used there to optimize runtime without losing
the advantages of serverless computing.

The CoDes project is headed by [Trever Schirmer](https://www.tu.berlin/en/mcc/about-us/team/trever-schirmer)
and executed in partnership with [DATEV eG](https://www.datev.de/web/de/startseite/startseite-n/).
The project duration is two years.

* ["Fusionize: Improving Serverless Application Performance through Feedback-Driven Function Fusion"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11533). T. Schirmer, J. Scheuner, T. Pfandzelter, D. Bermbach. 2023
* ["ProFaaStinate: Delaying Serverless Function Calls to Optimize Platform Performance"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15471). T. Schirmer, V. Carl, T. Pfandzelter, D. Bermbach. 2023

### SPENCER: Software Platform for Satellite-Based Serverless Edge and In-Network Computing in Remote Regions

<img src="/spencer-logo.png" style="width: 200px">

Edge computing is essential for new applications such as IoT and XR.
However, the high investment costs mean that edge infrastructure has so far been
preferred in urban, affluent regions.
The SPENCER project develops software abstractions to overcome the "digital divide"
and for remote IoT applications.
Methods for global, geo-distributed software deployment in the context of
satellite networks are primarily discussed.

The SPENCER project is headed by [Tobias Pfandzelter](https://www.tu.berlin/en/mcc/about-us/team/tobias-pfandzelter)
and executed in partnership with [Huawei Technologies GmbH](https://www.huawei.com/).
The project duration is one year.

* ["Serverless Abstractions for Edge Computing in Large Low-Earth Orbit Satellite Networks"](https://pfandzelter.com/publication/2023-mw-doctoralsymposium/doctoralsymposium-middleware2023.pdf). T. Pfandzelter, D. Bermbach. 2023
